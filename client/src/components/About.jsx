            <p>Hi! I&apos;m a Korean-born Canadian with experience in IT administration looking to specialize and pursue a career in Cloud Computing. The goal with this website and future projects is to build up my technical skills for potential Cloud Architect/Engineering roles. Also, I enjoy learning and tinkering with technology, so this has become one of my new hobbies.</p>
