              Welcome to my the first post in my blog! I&apos;ve been working on this website since the beginning of the year. It&apos;s been a log journey and hasn&apos;t been easy, but I&apos;m going to continue to build the site and look to create other projects to share.

              Since I&apos;ve been working on this site for awhile, I am planning on taking taking a little break to think about next steps and potential projects.
              I will be posting some challenges I had while creating this site as well as updates on progress for new projects when I have time, but I&apos;d like to spend some time on new hobbies I&apos;m looking to work on as well!

              I recently bought an electronic keyboard and electronic drum kit. I used to play piano growing up but never appreciated music back when I was a kid compared to now, so I want to reinvest time into learning piano again. Drums are an instrument I 
              always wanted to learn, but never had the opportunity. I just learned about mesh e-drum kits recently and had to pick one up so I can learn. I&apos; spent some time on both but had prioritized this site. Time to relax on this site a bit so I don&apos;t get too burnt out and enjoy other hobbies.

              My coworker has also lent me his copy of Shogun. There&apos;s been a new TV series released based on this story and he said the book was an excellent read. I also bought a few books but never spent any time reading them because I wanted to focus on this site. I will be spending some time reading Shogun. Maybe I can leave a book review on this site once I&apos;ve completed the book!

              I will try to continue to update this site when I can, but since my career goal isn&apos; in web development, I will focus on another project that utilizes more cloud services so that I can broaden and refine my technical skills. I will continue to update this site when I can because I enjoy the creation of websites. Hopefully there will be future updates and upgrades to the site down the road.

              Stay tuned!
